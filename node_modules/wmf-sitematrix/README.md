# WMF SiteMatrix

The goal of this project is to provide filtered versions of [Wikimedia's site matrix](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:SiteMatrix), as reported by the MediaWiki API in JSON format. Filtering allows Web applications like [iD](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD) to avoid loading the entire matrix just to integrate with a single project, such as Wikipedia.
